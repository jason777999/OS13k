## The Plan
- The idea is to build a tiny OS to host a variety of games, music, and apps that fits in 13 kilobytes
- The core of OS13k is around 7k zipped, and by using it's shared features we can pack a lot into 13k
- Programs should be in the 100-500 byte range, what matters most is how well it zips with everything else
- We plan to fit 10-20 programs [(probably not 26!)](http://js13kgames.com/entries/26-games-in-1) üòÖ
- **A very important rule for JS13k is that all content must be new, so no old stuff!**
- You can start with an old project but polish it up a lot, minify it and make it work with OS13k
- We will need to curate the best and perhaps smallest content for what actually lands in the JS13k build
- Anything left out of the JS13k build will still be available in the full GitHub version
- We make this repo public on day 1 of JS13k and open source everything, haven't decided on license yet

### [You can learn more about JS13k here](https://js13kgames.com/)

## Programming Info
- OS13k stores it's list of programs in programs.js
- For fast iteration when developing, the first program in the list opens automatically
- Though you can use images and other files, for JS13k we will need each program in one html file

Add an icon config to programs.js to register your program, and send me pull request, examples...
- {src:'system/test.html', name:'Hello!', icon:'‚úåÔ∏èüòÑ', reload:1, code:1, sticky:1}
- {src:'dweets/underwaterCavern.dweet.js', icon:'üåä', author:'Pavel'}
- {src:'toys/infiniteYinYangs.shader.txt', icon:'‚òØ', help:'Put instructions here.'}
- {src:'help.html'}

### Programs
- OS13k can open any html file and it will work the same as if opened directly
- Chrome is recommended for development, but Firefox is also supported
- [Some browsers like Firefox may not work locally if it treats local files as cross-origin](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/firefox-68-local-files-now-treated-as-cross-origin-1558299/42493/9)
- To force a page to refresh you can add ?(version) to the src link... {src:'Help.html?1'}
- Try to keep your program paused or light on cpu when it does not have focus, !document.hasFocus()
- Dweets and Shadertoys are automatically paused when not focused (unless sleep:0 is set)
- Prefix all local storage keys with OS13kYourProgramName to prevent collisions during JS13k
- OS13k works well on mobile devices, so we could have a separate entry for the JS13k mobile category
- We recommend [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) for development, but you can use whatever you want

### Minification Tips
- The goal is to fit as much as possible into 13 kilobytes so everything must be small and clean
- For inclusion in the JS13k build, programs need be around 100-500 bytes when minified
- *Always remember, this will be zipped! Don't over golf your code.*
- There is very little overhead for common functions calls and strings
- Don't worry to much about html tags, they will appear often and compress well
- Try to limit your use of non repeated text strings, those compresses the worst, use emojis where possible
- Don't compress your code in any way, let zip do the work for you
- Dweets and Shadertoys are great for making programs with reduced setup cost
- You do not need charset=utf-8, it will be applied automatically
- For the OS13k core system we am using [Google Closer](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) and [Terser](https://xem.github.io/terser-online)
- We will pack everything together into one giant html file before zipping to save space

### Games
- *JS13k is a game development competition, so we need to focus on games and fun apps*
- Don't put music in your games, music will be handled by music specific programs
- Use local storage to save your game's data (prefix keys with OS13kYourProgramName)
- Use JS13k features like trophies, seeded sound effects, and speech to enrich your games
- To add sounds with little space, use seeded sounds with a tiny function call OS13k.PlaySeed(seed)
- Dweets and Shaders are the smallest way to make games, check out Lava Rush for a shader example

### Apps
- Interaction between apps is one of the key ways we can make this interesting
- Keep text short and essential, try using emojis instead
- Apps that are creative or fun to use are are ideal
- Design your app well and let players have fun figuring out how to use it
- Think of how your app can enhance other apps and vice versa
- *Apps can play sounds and have trophies too!*

### Music
- [Keith Clark created a system to play tracker songs with ZzFX sound effects](https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM)
- We will include this in the OS as a core feature soon, something like OS13k.PlayMusic(musicData)
- We need music generators, synth instruments, and maybe even mini albums
- The idea is that players can listen to music while messing with games and apps
- The music tools can even work in conjunction with each other (step sequencer drum kit + piano)
- Music programs should continue playing if the frame loses focus, but maybe with reduced graphics to lower the load

### Dweets and Shadertoys
- Programs with the extension .dweet.js or .shader.txt or will automatically load as Dweets or Shadertoys!
- Dweets and Shadertoys are automatically paused when they don't have focus
- They also automatically have the show code option by default unless explictly disabled
- Dweets do not need to be 140 characters, there is no size limit
- Dweets can do anything that other programs can do including calling OS13k functions and ZzFX
- Shaders support iTime, iFrame, iMouse, iResolution, and iChannel0
- iChannel0 is an image of the previous frame, this can be used to make effects or even store game logic

### System Calls
- use the OS13k object to access the OS13k system
- OS13k is set after load, so if you need it on load use parent.OS13k
- zzfx also becomes available after your program loads and can be called directly
- Use the OS13k object to access OS13k features
- OS13k.CreateShader(canvas, shaderCode) - Create a shadertoy compatible webgl shader
- OS13k.RenderShader(canvas, shaderProgram, time=0, frame=0) - Render a shader
- OS13k.KeyDirection(key) - Get {x, y} position from a key code for WASD and arrow keys
- OS13k.PlaySamples(samples, sampleRate=44100) - Play audio samples
- OS13k.PlaySeed(seed, lengthScale=1, volume=1, randomness=.05) - Play a zzfx sound from seed
- OS13k.Speak(text, rate=1, pitch=1, volume=1, language='en') - Play speech of the text
- OS13k.KillHTML(string) - Stops HTML in string by setting all '<' to ''
- OS13k.Glitch(string, count) - Applies corruption to a string
- OS13k.Popup(html, speak) - shows a popup with given html, and optional speech

### Math Library
- Some basic math functions are provided to help reduce code duplication
- OS13k.Random(max=1, min=0) - Get a seeded random value clamped between min and max
- OS13k.randomSeed - You must set the seed before calling OS13k.Random
- OS13k.Clamp(a, min=0, max=1) - Clamp value between min and max
- OS13k.Percent(v, a, b) - Get clamped percent between a and b
- OS13k.Lerp(p, a, b) - Lerp clamped percent between a and b

### ZzFX
- ZzFX is a super tiny open source JavaScript sound effect synth, but don't let it's size fool you!
- Here is the sound designer for ZzFX with a link to the public repo https://zzfx.3d2k.com/
- ZzFx sounds can played directly by calling zzfx, volume is controlled by the system
- A seeded ZzFX sound player is available to save space with much smaller sound calls
- OS13k.PlaySeed(seed, lengthScale=1, volume=1, randomness=.05)
- Example OS13k.PlaySeed(1006), or make a function PlaySound=sound=>OS13k.PlaySeed([1006,5023,7][sound])
- *We will create a tool for browsing sound seeds soon*

### Program Settings and Defaults
- name - Display name (if absent will build nice name from camel case src filename)
- src - Source filename
- icon - Can contain html tags, fits about 2 emojis
- don't close html tags, they will automatically be closed
- width (720) and height (405) - Size of window (default is 16:9 aspect)
- help (optional) - Help message, shows an icon on the window's titlebar (try to keep it short)
- author (optional) - Name of creator
- reload (1) - Shows the reload option
- code (0) - Shows code option, defaults to true for dweets/shaders, help is shown instead if it exists
- full (1) - Enables full screen option
- sleep (1) - Dims window and pauses dweets/shaders when not focused
- sticky (0) - Will automatically open of program on restart if it was open
 
 # Trophies
 - Trophies are perhaps the most important part of OS13k and have many uses
 - Apps can register trophies for their games, the OS tracks which are unlocked
 - To unlock trophies use OS13k.Trophy(gameName, trophyName, icon, message)
 - You can pass in a value for message like a high score for example
 - "OS13kTrophy,gameName,trophyName,icon" is the unique local storage key for each trophy
 - *HTML tags and ',' can not used in trophy data, it will apper garbled*
 - When a new trophy is unlocked or the message is changed a popup will automatically appear
 - Total trophy count is shown in the taskbar and the trophy case shows all unlocked trophies
 - *You can use tophies to unlock stuff!* Use OS13k.GetTrophy to check if player has a trophy
 - *Keep your trophy names and messages short! Experiment with fun ideas and icons*
 - Trophies can be tested and cleared with the System/Test tool
 - You can even add unnamed trophies with just an icon and message

 ### Trophy Functions
 - OS13k.Trophy(game='', name='', icon='', message='', language='ja') - Unlock a trophy
 - OS13k.GetTrophy(game=0, name=0, icon=0) - Get most recent matching trophy, 0 if no trophy
 - OS13k.Trophies() - Get full list of trophy objects
 
 ### Word List
 - Every that OS13k comes across like from programs or trophies is added to the word list
 - This word list can be used to generate poems, song lyrics, or even games!
 - Collecting words is also a minigame and new words are read aloud when found
 - You can pass any string into AddWords and it will be stripped of punction, etc
 - The reason for this feature is because words zip poorly, so lets make the most of them
 - Words in the list can be from other JS13k game trophies!

 ### Word List Functions
 - OS13k.AddWords(string, speak) - adds new words in string, pass optional speak override string
 - GetWords() - get the full list of words
 - GetWord(minLength=0, maxLength, firstCharacters) - returns random matching word, '' if none found
 - RemoveWord(word) - removes the word from the list (only for users via word list window)
 
 ### Any JS13k game can use trophies, even if not part of OS13k!
 - To add a trophies to any JS13k game, just save a special key to localStorage!
 - The simplest way to add a single trophy is localStorage['OS13kTrophy,GameName']=''
 - For more control use localStorage['OS13kTrophy,GameName,TrophyName,Icon'] = Message
 - You can change the message to update the trophy, like a highscore for example
 - OS13k automatically checks localStorage and display popups for new trophies
 - This is possible because all JS13k games share the same local storage! Pretty cool right?
 - *Don't abuse the trophy system, lets agree to around 5 trophies per game*
