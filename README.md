# Welcome to OS13k!
OS13k is a tiny pseudo operating system designed for a JS13k community project. It includes native support for shadertoys, dweets,  zzfx sounds, medals, fullscreen, mobile support, and more. The OS (incuding zzfx, shadertoy, and dwitter support) is under 6k when zipped.

## Please keep this project confidential!

## The Plan
- My crazy idea is to make this tiny OS to host a variety of games and apps and fit it in 13k
- By sharing code like shader setup, dweets, and zzfx we can pack a lot into 13k
- OS13k is under 6k by itself, the bulk if it is mostly ZzFX, shader code, dweets and other shared code
- I'd like to see as many people as possible contribute tiny games and apps
- Programs should be in the 100-1000 byte range, what matters most is how well it compresses
- If apps are 500 bytes on average leveraging shared code, we can fit over 14 of them, probably more
- We could easily pack 1k of that with just like 10 or more really cool dweets and shaders
- A very important rule to the contest is that all content must be new, so no old stuff!
- You can start with an old project but polish it up a lot, minify it and make it work with OS13k
- We will need to curate the best and perhaps smallest content for what actualy lands in the JS13k build
- Anything left out of the JS13k build will still be available in the full GitHub version
- Another big part of this is the medal system that ANY JS13k game (even non-OS13k) can opt into
- It is still very early in development so all the apps are placeholders to be swapped out later
- We make this repo public on day 1 of Js13k and open source everything, I haven't decided on license
- I will submit a much reduced version on day 1 for people to test their games achevements on

## Programming Info
- OS13k stores it's desktop config in desktop.js
- For faster development iteration, the first desktopLayout in the list opens automatically
- Make sure to put your program in the proper subfolder

Add an icon config to desktop.js to register your program, and send me pull request, examples...
- {name:'Test', icon:'‚úåÔ∏è', src:'system/test.html', multiple:1, reload:1, code:1}
- {name:'Underwater Cavern', icon:'üåä', author:'Pavel', src:'dweets/underwaterCavern.dweet.js'}
- {name:'Yin Yangs', icon:'‚òØÔ∏è', src:'toys/infiniteYinYangs.shader.txt'}
- {src:'help.html'}

### Programming

- OS13k can open any html file with javascript and it will work the same as if opened directly
- Chrome is recommended for development, but Firefox is also supported.
- Firefox does not work in local mode because it treats local files as cross-origin
- Strict mode is not enforced but recommended to make minification easier
- To force a page to refresh you can add ?(version) to the src link... {src:'help.html?1'}
- Your program should be paused or light on cpu when it does not have focus, !document.hasFocus()
- Dweets and Shadertoys are automatically paused when not focued
- You do not need charset=utf-8, it will be applied automatically
- Prefix local storage keys with OS13k(program name) to prevent collisions
- OS13k works well on mobile devices, so we plan to have a separate entry for the JS13k mobile category
- Make use of the built in features of OS13k to save space in your code
- For now don't worry about submitting fully minified versions of your code, just keep it clean
- I will make a separate folder specifically for our minified build
- There is very little overhead for OS13k function call names, remember this will be zipped

### Shadertoys and Dweets

- Programs with the extension .shader.js or .dweet.js will automatically load as dweets or shadertoys!
- Shadertoys and dweets are automatically paused when they don't have focus
- They also automatically have reload and show code options applied
- Dweets do not need to be under 140 characers, so if you want to make a small app, maybe use a dweet
- Dweets can do anything that other programs can do including access OS13k and zzfx
- Shadertoy shaders support iTime, iMouse, iResolution, and iChannel0
- iChannel0 is a loop back image of the previous frame, this can be used to store game logic or make effects

### System Calls

- The function OS13kStart() is called on child frames when opened
- To acces OS13k features, use the OS13k object
- OS13k.CreateShader(canvas, shaderCode) - Create a shadertoy compatible webgl shader
- OS13k.RenderShader(canvas, shaderProgram, time=0) - Render a shader
- OS13k.Medal(gameName, medalName='', difficulty=0) - Register a medal for your game as complete
- OS13k.KeyDirection(key) - Get {x, y} position from a key code for WASD or arrow keys
- OS13k.PlaySamples(samples, sampleRate=44100) - Play audio samples
- OS13k.PlaySeed(seed, lengthScale=1, volume=1, randomness=.05) - Play a zzfx sound from seed
- OS13k.Speak(text) - Play speech of the text

### ZzFX
- ZzFX is my super tiny sound synth which is also on GitHub, but don't let it's size fool you
- Here is the sound desinger for ZzFX with a link to the public repo https://zzfx.3d2k.com/
- ZzFx sounds can played directly by calling zzfx, volume is controlled by the system
- A seeded ZzFX sound player is available to save space with much smaller sound calls
- Example OS13k.PlaySeed(1006), I will create a tool for looking for sound seeds soon

### Math Library
- OS13k.Random(max=1, min=0) - Get a seeded random value, OS13k.randomSeed to set the seed
- OS13k.Clamp(a, min=0, max=1) - Clamp value between min and max
- OS13k.Percent(v, a, b) - Get clamped percent between a and b
- OS13k.Lerp(p, a, b) - Lerp clamped percent between a and b
- Let me know if anything else should be included, I am considering adding a vector class

### Icon settings
- width and height - Size of window
- author - Name of creator
- multiple - Allows multiple copies of the window to open
- reload - Shows the reload page icon to reload your program
- code - Option to show the code for your program
 
 ### Medals (not yet implemented)
 - Apps can register medals for their games, the os tracks which are unlocked
 - A function is provided for apps to unlock medals, OS13k.Medal(gameName, medalName='', difficulty=0)
 - Medals will have 3 difficulty levels 0-2 with different point values
 - Players can view all their medals and total points will be shown on the taskbar
 
 ### Any JS13k game can use medals, even if not part of OS13k!
 - To add a medal to any JS13k game, just save a special key to localStorage
 - The simplest way to add a single medal is save localStorage.OS13kMedals_GAMENAME=1 when the player wins
 - For more control use localStorage.OS13kMedals_GAMENAME = [{"medalName":name,"difficulty":difficultyl}...]
 - Both medal name and difficulty are optional
 - When OS13k is next run, it will search locaStorage and display medals unlocked by other games
 - This is possible because all JS13k games share the same local storage! Pretty cool right?
 
 ### Resources
 - [Dwitter](https://www.dwitter.net/) - The source of so much amazing tiny code
 - [The Dweetabase](http://dweetabase.3d2k.com/), and offline searable database of every dweet
 - [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) - There are many amazing tweet and 2 tweet sized shaders
 - [JS1k](https://js1k.com/) - I imagine with so much shared code and zip we could fit many of these size
 - [JS13k](https://js13kgames.com/) - This is our goal

### Potential Features
- Vertex shader customization (currently it is always a quad)
- More Shadertoy paremeters, custom textures
- Multi pass Shadertoys
