<p>Welcome to OS13k!</p>
<p>This is a tiny pseudo operating system designed for a JS13k community project. It includes support for webgl shaders, zzfx, medals, and other useful functions.</p>
<p>Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to help us fill it up with as much cool stuff as we can fit.</p>
<p><u><b>Please keep this project confidential!</b></u></p>
